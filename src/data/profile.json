  "bio1": "Hi there! My name is John and I'm a full stack web developer based in New Hampshire with a preference towards back end development. I'm currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire. I decided to pursue a career in software development because I enjoy the challenge of working through a problem. That feeling you get after you spend loads of time working through a problem and finally coming to a solution can definitely become addicting.",
  "bio2": "My current career in retail has given me plenty of experience in customer service. As a framing department manager I've also had experience running a team of employees as well as making sure business goals are met. Even in my retail career I would always take a problem solving approach to any challenges I would come across. Over time I realized that my favorite orders to work on were the ones that challenged me to think outside the box to solve the problem. This lead me to software development. Feel free to scroll through my site here to see some of the projects I've worked on. If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out to me. Check out the link to my contacts page and message me if you'd like.",
